# Alessandrina

This project aims to build a Go-based serverless application using AWS SAM. It provides an API with endpoints for interacting with a book database, allowing users to search, create, and delete books. The project also includes a robust CI/CD pipeline for automated build, test, and deployment using GitHub Actions.
